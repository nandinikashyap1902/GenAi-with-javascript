# Railway Deployment Guide - RAG System Backend

This guide will walk you through deploying your RAG system backend to Railway.

## üìã Prerequisites

1. **Railway Account**: Sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. **GitHub Account**: Your code should be in a GitHub repository
3. **OpenAI API Key**: Get one from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)

---

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Deployment

### **Step 1: Prepare Your Repository**

1. **Initialize Git (if not already done)**
   ```bash
   cd "c:\Users\kashy\OneDrive\Desktop\GenAi-with-javascript\Rag system"
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - RAG system"
   ```

2. **Create a GitHub repository**
   - Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
   - Create a new repository (e.g., `rag-system`)
   - Don't initialize with README (you already have files)

3. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/rag-system.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

---

### **Step 2: Set Up Railway Project**

1. **Login to Railway**
   - Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Click "Login" and sign in with GitHub

2. **Create a New Project**
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Authorize Railway to access your repositories
   - Select your `rag-system` repository

3. **Configure Build Settings**
   - Railway will auto-detect the Dockerfile in the `backend` folder
   - Root directory: `/backend` (or select the backend folder)
   - Railway will use the Dockerfile we created

---

### **Step 3: Set Up Qdrant Vector Database**

You have two options for Qdrant:

#### **Option A: Use Qdrant Cloud** (Recommended - Easiest)

1. **Sign up for Qdrant Cloud**
   - Go to [cloud.qdrant.io](https://cloud.qdrant.io)
   - Sign up for free account
   - Free tier: 1GB storage, perfect for testing

2. **Create a Cluster**
   - Click "Create Cluster"
   - Select "Free" tier
   - Choose a region (closest to your Railway region)
   - Wait ~2-3 minutes for provisioning

3. **Get Connection Details**
   - Copy the **Cluster URL** (e.g., `https://xyz-example.aws.cloud.qdrant.io:6333`)
   - Copy the **API Key** from cluster settings
   - You'll add these to Railway environment variables

#### **Option B: Deploy Qdrant on Railway** (More Complex)

1. **Create New Service**
   - In your Railway project, click "New"
   - Select "Empty Service"
   - Name it "qdrant"

2. **Configure Docker Deployment**
   - Go to service "Settings" ‚Üí "Source"
   - Under "Deploy from Docker Image"
   - Enter image: `qdrant/qdrant:v1.7.0`
   - Click "Deploy"

3. **Add Volume (Important for persistence)**
   - Go to "Settings" ‚Üí "Volumes"
   - Click "Add Volume"
   - Mount path: `/qdrant/storage`
   - Size: 1GB (or more)

4. **Configure Networking**
   - Qdrant will be available at: `qdrant.railway.internal:6333`
   - No need to expose publicly

5. **Wait for Deployment**
   - Check logs to ensure it's running
   - Should see: "Qdrant is ready"

**Which option to choose?**
- **Qdrant Cloud**: Easier, managed, free tier available
- **Railway Qdrant**: More control, all in one place, costs ~$2-4/month

---

### **Step 4: Configure Environment Variables**

1. **Go to your backend service** in Railway dashboard

2. **Click on "Variables" tab**

3. **Add the following environment variables:**

   **If using Qdrant Cloud (Option A):**
   ```bash
   # Required Variables
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-api-key-here
   
   # Qdrant Cloud Configuration
   QDRANT_URL=https://xyz-example.aws.cloud.qdrant.io:6333
   QDRANT_API_KEY=your-qdrant-api-key-here
   
   # Server Configuration
   PORT=5000
   NODE_ENV=production
   
   # CORS - Add your Vercel frontend URL
   ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://gen-ai-with-javascript.vercel.app,http://localhost:3000
   ```

   **If using Railway Qdrant (Option B):**
   ```bash
   # Required Variables
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-api-key-here
   
   # Railway Qdrant Configuration (internal networking)
   QDRANT_URL=http://qdrant.railway.internal:6333
   QDRANT_API_KEY=
   
   # Server Configuration
   PORT=5000
   NODE_ENV=production
   
   # CORS - Add your Vercel frontend URL
   ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://gen-ai-with-javascript.vercel.app,http://localhost:3000
   ```

   **Important Notes:**
   - Replace `sk-your-actual-openai-api-key-here` with your real OpenAI API key
   - For Qdrant Cloud: Use the URL and API key from your cluster dashboard
   - For Railway Qdrant: Use `qdrant.railway.internal:6333` (Railway's internal networking)
   - Update `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` with your actual Vercel URL

4. **Save the variables** - Railway will auto-deploy

---

### **Step 5: Deploy and Monitor**

1. **Wait for Deployment**
   - Railway will build your Docker image
   - This takes 3-5 minutes on first deploy
   - Watch the logs in the "Deployments" tab

2. **Check Deployment Logs**
   - Click on "Deployments" tab
   - Select the latest deployment
   - Check for any errors
   - Look for: `Server is running on port 5000`

3. **Common Issues & Fixes:**

   **Problem: Build fails**
   - Check the Dockerfile path is correct
   - Ensure `backend` folder is selected as root directory

   **Problem: Qdrant connection fails**
   - Verify `QDRANT_URL` uses Railway's internal URL
   - Check Qdrant service is running

   **Problem: Out of memory**
   - Increase RAM in Settings ‚Üí Resources
   - Default is 512MB, try 1GB

---

### **Step 6: Get Your Backend URL**

1. **Generate Public URL**
   - Go to "Settings" tab
   - Under "Networking" ‚Üí "Public Networking"
   - Click "Generate Domain"
   - Railway will provide a URL like: `your-app.railway.app`

2. **Copy this URL** - you'll need it for the frontend

3. **Test the Backend**
   - Visit: `https://your-app.railway.app/api/health`
   - You should see: `{"status":"ok","message":"Server is running"}`

---

### **Step 7: Update CORS for Frontend**

After deploying your frontend to Vercel (next step), you'll need to:

1. **Get your Vercel URL** (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app`)

2. **Update Railway environment variable:**
   - Go to Railway ‚Üí Variables
   - Update `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`:
     ```
     ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-app.vercel.app,http://localhost:3000
     ```

3. **Railway will auto-redeploy** with new CORS settings

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start
1. Check environment variables are set correctly
2. View deployment logs for errors
3. Ensure Dockerfile builds successfully locally

### Qdrant connection errors
1. Verify Qdrant service is running (green status)
2. Check `QDRANT_URL` uses internal Railway URL
3. Test connection in logs

### CORS errors
1. Verify `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` includes your frontend URL
2. Check frontend is using correct backend URL
3. View browser console for specific origin being blocked

### File upload issues
1. Railway has ephemeral filesystem (files don't persist)
2. Your current setup is OK (files are processed then deleted)
3. For permanent storage, use S3 or Railway volumes
